/*.Q.1. A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the workshop. The list
includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a customer
wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system searches the list and
displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed. If it is,
then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the
requested copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed otherwise, the
message “Required copies not in stock” is displayed. WAP using a class called Books with
suitable member functions and constructors.*/
