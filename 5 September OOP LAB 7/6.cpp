/*6. Create a class ‘Employee’ which stores employee name, id and salary. Derive two classes
from ‘Employee’ class: ‘Regular’ and ‘Part-Time’. The ‘Regular’ class stores DA, HRA, and
basic salary. The ‘Part-Time’ class stores the number of hours and pay per hour. Calculate the
salary of a regular employee and a part-time employee.*/
